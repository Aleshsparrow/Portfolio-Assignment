# Portfolio-Assignment

## About the project.
* This project is aimed at giving a glimpse of my web-development abilities to potential employers and/or clients. I made the design on this project very simple and concise but yet compelling anyone that sees it to want to see more of my projects.

    I started out by sketching my intended design on a notepad and adding all the major components and the correct tags to use.

    I wrote the codes for my index.html file first then wrote the code for the style.css after.
    Since all three pages have the same layout, I used my index.html code as basis for the other two html files (portfolio.html and contact.html) and used the same style sheet for all three html files.

    Link to the live website can be found in the contact section.
